this is the first excercice i had 
``` 
A, B are entered, which are perceived as the sides of the postcard, specified in mm.

X, Y are entered, which are perceived as the sides of the envelope, given in mm.

Check if the postcard can be put into an envelope
```

how did i solve it ? 

for me i like to read documentatoins so i readed the basics from W3School to lean the syntaxe on how to declare a variable and read it extt..
and then i analysed the problem and writed my own solutoin and of course i had alot of errors, but how did i solve it ? 

for me ai bots are my privet teachers, i use black ai box, i shared my code and ask for correcting my code and to explain 
in details on what is the problem and how to correct it, so i can understand in depth and learn from my mistakes.

```

int main()
{
    
    
    std::cout << "enter the sides of the postcard (A and B in mm):";
    int A, B;
    std::cin >> A >> B;

    std::cout << "enter the sides of the envelope (X and Y in mm):";
    int X, Y;
    std::cin >> X >> Y;

    if (A < 0 || B < 0 || X < 0 || Y < 0) {
        std::cout << "Invalid input. Please enter non-negative values." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }
    
    if (A <= X && B <= Y || A <= Y && B <= X) {
        std::cout << "The postcard will fit into the envelope." << std::endl;
    }
    else {
        std::cout << "The postcard won't fit into the envelope." << std::endl;
    }
}
```
